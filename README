NAME
    GraphViz::DBI - Graph database tables and relations

VERSION
    version 1.100860

SYNOPSIS
      use GraphViz::DBI;
      my $dbh = DBI->connect('...', '...', '...');
      print GraphViz::DBI->new($dbh)->graph_tables->as_png;

DESCRIPTION
    This module constructs a graph for a database showing tables and
    connecting them if they are related. While or after constructing the
    object, pass an open database handle, then call "graph_tables" to
    determine database metadata and construct a GraphViz graph from the
    table and field information.

    The methods described here are defined by this class; all other method
    calls are passed to the underlying GraphViz object:

METHODS
  new([$dbh])
    Constructs the object; also creates a GraphViz object. The constructor
    accepts an optional open database handle.

  set_dbh($dbh)
    Sets the database handle.

  get_dbh()
    Returns the database handle.

  get_tables()
    Returns the tables defined in the database.

  is_table($table)
    Checks the database metadata whether the argument is a valid table name.

  is_foreign_key($table, $field)
    Determines whether the field belonging to the table is a foreign key
    into some other table. If so, it is expected to return the name of that
    table. If not, it is expected to return a false value.

    For example, if there is a table called "product" and another table
    contains a field called "product_id", then to indicate that this field
    is a foreign key into the product table, the method returns "product".
    This is the logic implemented in this class. You can override this
    method in a subclass to suit your needs.

  graph_tables()
    This method goes through all tables and fields and calls appropriate
    methods to determine which tables and which dependencies exist, then
    hand the results over to GraphViz. It returns the GraphViz object.

FEATURE IDEAS
    *   Test with various database drivers to see whether they support the
        metadata interface.

    *   Make each table a vertical port with dependencies using those ports.

    *   Provide the possibility to name edges to specify the type of
        relationship ('has-a', 'is-a', etc.).
